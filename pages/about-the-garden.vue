    <h1>This is my Digital Garden</h1>
    <p>
      Here you will find notes, articles, texts, essays and some of my ideas,
      all interconnected like a wiki.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Digital Garden?</h2>
    <p>
      Let's suppose that all of the posts here are different kinds of plants.
      Just like plants, they take some time to develop and grow. This means that
      all of the content here can change as I mature my ideas and gain new
      knowledge on the topics I'm writing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main goal of such place is to share my knowledge and ideas, while also
      making public all of my learning process. Learning in public makes me open
      to feedback and guidance on my mistakes, so feel free to let me know 
      if you think I'm wrong or if I've missed any important details
    </p>
    <p>

      since she was a great inspiration for me to start my own gardening
      journey.

    <h2>Organization of the Posts</h2>
    <p>
      There are three stages a post can belong to: <b>seedling</b>, <b>budding</b> and
      <b>evergreen</b>. (yeah, I stole them from
      <a href="https://maggieappleton.com" target="_blank">Maggie's garden</a>):
      <ul>
        <li><b>Seedling</b>: Newly planted ideas, very early in development.</li>
        <li><b>Budding</b>: I've worked on the text a little, but it still needs more attention.</li>
        <li><b>Evergreen</b>: Texts that I consider to be as complete as possible, they won't change much, but I might still trim it a little.</li>
      </ul>
      They will also be organized in two categories:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Thoughts</b>: My take on something, it can be any topic.</li>
        <li><b>Knowledge</b>: Texts resulted from my studies on certain topics. My goal is to avoid misinformation and be as correct as possible.</li>
      </ul>
      And lastly, organized by <b>topics</b>, such as <b>Tech</b>, <b>Humanities</b>, <b>Travels</b>, <b>Music</b>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that all of this organization can change at any time. Digital gardens don't really follow any hierarchy, and tend to be as organic as possible.
