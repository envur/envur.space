    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Gustavo and I'm
      {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2003 }} years old. I'm a Brazilian techie
      guy, currently working on software development as a full-stack dev for a
      small software house. I'm interested mainly on DevSecOps, Networks, Cloud
      Computing and basically anything that involves CyberSecurity. Currently
      open for new opportunities that can help me to get into these fields.

    <p>
      I'm also a huge sucker for social sciences and humanities. I believe that
      understanding our past and how we, as humans, relate with each other and
      the spaces we live is critical to building a better world for everyone
      (yes, eat the rich, thanks). Philosophy, sociology, history, anthropology,
      and politics are some of my favorite topics to explore when I'm not diving
      in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not working nor studying anything about tech, I'm usually playing
      (very badly) the guitar, reading, hanging out with people who are
      important to me or traveling. My goal after ending college is to travel
      the world and learn more about this little blue planet lost in a random
      corner of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very passionate about music and am a self-taught guitarist, which
      ain't much, but I'm kinda proud of the noise I make. I'm constantly
      studying and practicing in order to become a better musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I have a deep passion for learning languages. It's such a great
      way to connect with people and stories from all around the world. In the
      future, I hope to use my language skills to travel to new places, meet new
      interesting people, and collaborate on some interesting projects.
      Currently, I'm focusing on Russian and I'll get to Spanish, French,
      Japanese, and pretty much any other language that catches my attention.
