# Networking 101

I've always wanted to dive deeper into computer networking. Since I'm currently working as a programmer, I just know enough to get my job done, which is far from the ideal, at least for me.

Here I'll write an overview of the topic and place all the necessary links for other posts in the garden and also resources from various places of the web.

## What is a computer network?

In the book "Computer Networks", written by Andrew Tanenbaun and David Wetherall, a computer network is defined as "a collection of autonomous computers **interconnected by a single technology**". This means that, if you have two or more computers that are able to exchange information¹ through a technology (copper wire, fiber optics, microwave, bluetooth), then you have a computer network.

> ¹ As stated by Tanenbaun and Wetherall: "Two computers are said to be interconnected if they are able to exchange information".
